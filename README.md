SaveYourEyes
============

I have written this code for eye specific excercise (20:20:20 http://www.labnol.org/software/computer-eye-exercise/14069/) 

What this code will do?
It will cover the full screen of your computer after 20-25 Minutes for 20 second and you have to look at distant object for these 20 seconds.

How can I grab this code?
Copy 3 classes from src folder and paste it in any java project. Then you can run TwentyTwentyTest java file directly or export it as Excecutable jar and run as java -jar {jar-name}.jar from command prompt.

Current state of project requires basic java knowledge.
